The goal of this project is to empower a "slow down, kids playing" sign.

By using sensors to detect if a car is coming that fails to slow down to 15mph, we can send a signal to the receiver (which would be a bluetooth speaker) that can pause any music or media playing on it to let the kids know that a car is coming and they should get off of the road.
Currently there is a functioning prototype utilizing a pair of sonar sensors with PIR sensors, but I am hoping to migrate the logic over to a microwave sensor for more accurate speed readings.
